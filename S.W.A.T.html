        <h3 class="what">Review</h3>
        <p class="paragrafo">
            This inclusion-rich series can be pretty routine, yet at the same time it delivers and sometimes exceeds genre expectation.
            It's dealing with the politics, sensitivities and occasional humor of policing in L.A.
